🎓 Authenticity Validator for Academia

A blockchain-based authenticity verification system designed for academic institutions to validate certificates, research papers, and academic records.  
This project leverages smart contracts and decentralized storage (IPFS) to ensure transparency, immutability, and verifiable trust for all academic credential.
🚀 Project Overview

The **Authenticity Validator for Academia** enables universities and institutions to issue, store, and verify documents securely using blockchain technology.  
It eliminates the risk of fake certificates, tampering, and manual verification delays by providing a public, tamper-proof validation system.


## 🌍 Project Vision
To build a decentralized academic validation system that eliminates document forgery, enhances trust among universities and employers, and empowers students with verifiable digital credentials.

🧩 Key Features

- 🧾 Certificate Issuance— Institutions can issue certificates stored on IPFS and registered on the blockchain.  
- 🔍 Verification System — Anyone can verify authenticity by checking the blockchain record.  
- 🧠 Creator / Institution Dashboard** — Manage academic documents with a clean UI.  
- 🧑‍🎓 Student Access — Students can securely view and share their verified credentials.  
- 🛡️ Immutability— Data stored on blockchain ensures long-term trust and transparency.  
- ⚡ Smart Contracts — Written in Solidity, powered by Hardhat for deployment and testing.  

🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React / Next.js | User dashboard for institutions and verifiers 
| **Blockchain** | Solidity + Hardhat | Smart contract logic for document management |
| Storage | IPFS / Pinata | Decentralized storage for academic content (CIDs) |
| Backend (optional) | Node.js / Express | API layer for authentication and metadata |
| Network | Ethereum / Polygon / Local Hardhat | Smart contract deployment environment |

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems.
- Multi-institution support with access control.
- NFT-based digital certificates.
- Cross-chain compatibility for global academic verification.
